# MENTOR REVIEW QUEUE — patient-facing clinical wording awaiting physio-mentor sign-off

Standing rule (CLAUDE.md): patient-facing clinical wording changes get flagged for
Pawan's physio mentor before shipping. Strings tagged **interim-live pending mentor**
are live in the product now (R6 demo) and must be reviewed at the next mentor session.
Remove a row once the mentor approves it (or replace the string and re-tag).

## R6-P2 — spoken exercise briefing, `commonMistake` lines (v1_exercise_execute.html)

| Exercise def | String | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| SQUAT | "Most common mistake: letting your knees drift past your toes. Sit your hips back and keep your knees behind your toes." | author: Pawan — live |
| SQUAT_PARTIAL | "Most common mistake: going deeper than feels comfortable. Only go as far down as you can without pain." | interim-live pending mentor |
| HINGE | "Most common mistake: bending the knees and turning it into a squat. Push your hips back and keep your knees only softly bent." | interim-live pending mentor |
| LUNGE | "Most common mistake: taking too short a step. Take a big step so your front knee stays over your foot." | interim-live pending mentor |
| SL_RDL | "Most common mistake: rushing and losing balance. Move slowly, and keep your standing foot pressed into the floor." | interim-live pending mentor |
| GLUTE_BRIDGE_SUPINE | "Most common mistake: pushing through your toes. Keep your heels down and drive through them as you lift." | interim-live pending mentor |
